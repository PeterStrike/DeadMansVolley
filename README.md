DeadMansVolley

This game was initally part of a univercity project I did at Aberystwyth University for the final year of my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Graphics, Vision And Games. I have continued to develop this game as I have enjoyed making it and would like to see it become a more fleshed out expeariance. 

The game is designed to focus and expand on the common gameplay trope called 'Dead Man's Volley'/'Tennise Boss'.

To my current knowlage, this game is not to be sold for profit, in acordance with the 'Aberystwyth University & Bangor University Common Intellectual Property Policy'. Link here for further details-: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/hr/policy-and-procedure/au-and-bu/intellectual-property/
