DeadMansVolley

This game was initally part of a univercity project I did at Aberystwyth University for the final year of my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Graphics, Vision And Games. I have continued to develop this game as I have enjoyed making it and would like to see it become a more fleshed out expeariance. 

The game is designed to focus and expand on the common gameplay trope called 'Dead Man's Volley'/'Tennise Boss'.

The file 'DeadmansVolley' is the Unity project file. This is provided should people want to know hot the game works

GameBuilds has finished builds of the game as executables. Each build have a version number and a build date. Please try to stick to the newest version.

To my current knowlage, this game is not to be sold for profit, in acordance with the 'Aberystwyth University & Bangor University Common Intellectual Property Policy'. Link here for further details-: https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/hr/policy-and-procedure/au-and-bu/intellectual-property/
